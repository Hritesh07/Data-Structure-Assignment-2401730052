# Data-Structure-Assignment-2401730052
This repository contains my solutions and implementations for Data Structures assignments.
The goal of this repo is to practice fundamental data structures, improve problem-solving skills, and build a strong foundation in algorithms.


📂 Contents - Assignments


⚙️ How to Run - 
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/username/ds-assignments.git


Navigate into the folder:
cd ds-assignments


Compile and run the code (example in C++):
g++ assignment1.cpp -o assignment1
./assignment1
(Adjust commands depending on the programming language used — C++, Python, Java, etc.)


🛠 Languages & Tools - C++ / Java / Python (depending on assignment)
Standard libraries for DS & Algo


📌 Notes - 
Each assignment folder contains:
README.md with problem statements / explanations
Source code files (.cpp, .py, .java)
Sample input/output (if applicable)


🚀 Future Work - 
Add complexity analysis for each implementation
Add unit tests for validation
Include visualizations for certain data structures


🙌 Contributing - 
If you find mistakes or have suggestions, feel free to open a pull request or raise an issue.
